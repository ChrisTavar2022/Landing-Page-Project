      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We were a couple with a dream and we made it happen!</p>
      <h2>Beginnings of KC Old Times</h2>
      <p>
        Prior to starting our retro games and toys business, we were a couple
        with a dream! We felt miserable working a 9 to 5 shift every day! So, at
        one point we decided to start a business with something that we really
        enjoy being our primary product or service! That is when we landed on a
        family owned retro games and toys store!
      </p>
      <h2>The Present</h2>
      <p>
        Thanks to the success of our business, we have expanded our store! We
        offer the best quality and prices on all things related to retro games
        and toys!
